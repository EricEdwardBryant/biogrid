"BIOGRID:0000050","PCA","is_a","BIOGRID:0000041","A Protein-Fragment Complementation Assay (PCA) is a protein-protein interaction assay in which a bait protein is expressed as fusion to one of the either N- or C- terminal peptide fragments of a reporter protein and prey protein is expressed as fusion to the complementary N- or C- terminal fragment of the same reporter protein. Interaction of bait and prey proteins bring together complementary fragments, which can then fold into an active reporter, e.g. the split-ubiquitin assay. [BIOGRID:curators]"
